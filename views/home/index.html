   <p> Welcome to my project with NYOT. Over the course of this school year, I have learned many skills that have helped me in designing this here page. Though it may not seem like it to others, a lot of work was put in to creating this page. Special thanks to other NYOT students who have helped made this possible and helped me with any difficulties i was having. You guys are the real MVPS</p>
